# Flatirons Development Front-end React Developer Coding Test

Be sure to read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines within.

## Context

Use React to implement the following Figma design. It is a fake onboarding flow. Please review all comments on the Figma file before starting so you understand the picture of what you're building.

[Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/OM8Qc9Nxevqo8dXPXIk1dM/React-Developer-Test) (make sure you are logged in)

Use this Figma file to see button states, colors, and responsive design.  You should be sure to complete the test to mimic the design as seen.

## Requirements

1. Use libraries of your choice
2. If you have time, please adjust for the mobile design in the Figma file.
3. Please see submission requirements and include a walk-through of your code and the experience.
4. Do not use redux nor local storage. Use a concept built into React.
5. Write one test

### Bonus

- TypeScript
- Also create mobile version included in Figma
- Write concise and clear commit messages
- Include a subtle animation to focus attention
- Describe improvement opportunities when you conclude
